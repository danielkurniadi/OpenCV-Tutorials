# Python OpenCV Tutorial Collections

Collections of all tutorials from OpenCV in Python. This repository includes quick notebook and the example source code itself and along with the data/images needed to play along. The tutorials are available in the [OpenCV official docs](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials). In case you're too lazy to read those docs, just clone this repo and read these notebooks.
